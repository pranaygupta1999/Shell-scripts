1
0:00:07.928 --> 0:00:10.347
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace

2
0:00:10.348 --> 0:00:13.968
has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar

3
0:00:13.968 --> 0:00:18.128
hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe.

4
0:00:18.128 --> 0:00:20.435
Little do they know that a third party—

5
0:00:20.435 --> 0:00:21.794
Sausage Saloon—

6
0:00:21.795 --> 0:00:25.055
has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation.

7
0:00:25.055 --> 0:00:29.775
As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge,

8
0:00:29.775 --> 0:00:33.945
to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception.

9
0:00:33.945 --> 0:00:38.010
You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner.

10
0:00:38.010 --> 0:00:42.029
From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass,

11
0:00:42.029 --> 0:00:45.441
while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones

12
0:00:45.441 --> 0:00:47.561
speaks into a microphone.

13
0:00:47.561 --> 0:00:50.821
“We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault,

14
0:00:50.821 --> 0:00:54.940
in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300.

15
0:00:54.941 --> 0:00:59.101
Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?”

16
0:00:59.101 --> 0:01:02.881
You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying.

17
0:01:02.881 --> 0:01:06.206
The interrogator, however, falls for it.

18
0:01:06.206 --> 0:01:09.806
He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?”

19
0:01:09.806 --> 0:01:14.026
Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying,

20
0:01:14.026 --> 0:01:16.947
while the interrogator takes 
him at his word.

21
0:01:16.947 --> 0:01:19.937
He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?”

22
0:01:19.937 --> 0:01:23.077
This time the chef answers truthfully.

23
0:01:23.077 --> 0:01:25.357
The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says,

24
0:01:25.357 --> 0:01:29.607
“Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one,

25
0:01:29.607 --> 0:01:31.293
we’ll be done here.”

26
0:01:31.293 --> 0:01:33.443
But as the chef starts to answer,

27
0:01:33.443 --> 0:01:37.443
the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view.

28
0:01:37.443 --> 0:01:39.673
Within moments he rushes out of the room,

29
0:01:39.673 --> 0:01:44.623
announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe.

30
0:01:44.623 --> 0:01:48.503
You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number.

31
0:01:48.503 --> 0:01:52.363
But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself?

32
0:01:52.363 --> 0:01:54.623
Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself.

33
0:01:54.623 --> 0:01:55.333
Answer in 3

34
0:01:55.333 --> 0:01:58.123
Answer in 2

35
0:01:58.123 --> 0:02:00.803
Answer in 1

36
0:02:00.803 --> 0:02:03.103
The key here is to work backwards.

37
0:02:03.103 --> 0:02:06.223
We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question

38
0:02:06.223 --> 0:02:08.173
or whether he answers truthfully.

39
0:02:08.173 --> 0:02:11.373
But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it,

40
0:02:11.373 --> 0:02:14.143
he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers–

41
0:02:14.143 --> 0:02:18.403
one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t.

42
0:02:18.403 --> 0:02:22.307
Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions

43
0:02:22.307 --> 0:02:25.047
that lead to just two possibilities.

44
0:02:25.047 --> 0:02:26.817
Of the three constraints offered,

45
0:02:26.817 --> 0:02:31.537
the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube.

46
0:02:31.537 --> 0:02:36.352
That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300.

47
0:02:36.352 --> 0:02:41.303
So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES.

48
0:02:41.303 --> 0:02:43.474
Now, let’s look at the second question.

49
0:02:43.474 --> 0:02:46.944
If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square,

50
0:02:46.944 --> 0:02:52.263
it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729–

51
0:02:52.264 --> 0:02:57.007
the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube.

52
0:02:57.007 --> 0:03:00.225
But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit.

53
0:03:00.225 --> 0:03:04.295
So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO.

54
0:03:04.295 --> 0:03:09.075
And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list,

55
0:03:09.075 --> 0:03:12.204
leaving only six numbers.

56
0:03:12.205 --> 0:03:16.295
Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list.

57
0:03:16.295 --> 0:03:20.091
If the chef answered YES to the number 
being less than 500,

58
0:03:20.092 --> 0:03:22.862
we’d have four options, which is too many.

59
0:03:22.862 --> 0:03:26.802
But a NO leaves us with two numbers 
greater than 500,

60
0:03:26.802 --> 0:03:30.792
one of which does have 
a 1 as its second digit.

61
0:03:30.792 --> 0:03:34.532
We don’t know which of these numbers 
the interrogator thinks is correct.

62
0:03:34.532 --> 0:03:35.772
But that doesn’t matter–

63
0:03:35.772 --> 0:03:38.952
remember, his conclusion 
was based on lies.

64
0:03:38.952 --> 0:03:44.152
You, on the other hand, are now in a 
position to reconstruct the truth.

65
0:03:44.152 --> 0:03:48.702
First, the chef said the number was 
greater than 500 but lied,

66
0:03:48.704 --> 0:03:51.904
meaning it’s actually less than 500.

67
0:03:51.904 --> 0:03:56.293
Second, the chef said it wasn’t a 
perfect square but lied again,

68
0:03:56.294 --> 0:03:59.211
meaning the number is indeed a square.

69
0:03:59.211 --> 0:04:03.201
And finally, he truthfully confirmed 
that it was also a cube.

70
0:04:03.201 --> 0:04:04.851
And as we’ve already seen,

71
0:04:04.851 --> 0:04:10.671
the only number under 500 that’s 
both a square and a cube is 64.

72
0:04:10.671 --> 0:04:15.301
You find the secret recipe and are gone 
before anyone’s the wiser.

73
0:04:15.301 --> 0:04:17.750
Corporate espionage is not an easy game—

74
0:04:17.750 --> 0:04:21.750
but sometimes, that’s just 
how the sausage is made.
