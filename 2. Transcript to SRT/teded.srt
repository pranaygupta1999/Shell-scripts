1
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,347
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace

2
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,968
has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar

3
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:18,128
hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe.

4
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:20,435
Little do they know that a third party—

5
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:21,794
Sausage Saloon—

6
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:25,055
has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation.

7
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:29,775
As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge,

8
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:33,945
to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception.

9
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:38,010
You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,029
From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass,

11
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:45,441
while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones

12
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,561
speaks into a microphone.

13
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,821
“We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault,

14
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,940
in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300.

15
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:59,101
Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?”

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,881
You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying.

17
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:06,206
The interrogator, however, falls for it.

18
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,806
He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?”

19
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:14,026
Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying,

20
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:16,947
while the interrogator takes 
him at his word.

21
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:19,937
He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?”

22
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:23,077
This time the chef answers truthfully.

23
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:25,357
The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says,

24
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:29,607
“Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one,

25
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,293
we’ll be done here.”

26
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:33,443
But as the chef starts to answer,

27
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:37,443
the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view.

28
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:39,673
Within moments he rushes out of the room,

29
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:44,623
announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe.

30
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:48,503
You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number.

31
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:52,363
But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself?

32
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,623
Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself.

33
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:55,333
Answer in 3

34
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,123
Answer in 2

35
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,803
Answer in 1

36
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,103
The key here is to work backwards.

37
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,223
We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question

38
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:08,173
or whether he answers truthfully.

39
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,373
But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it,

40
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,143
he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers–

41
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:18,403
one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t.

42
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:22,307
Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions

43
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,047
that lead to just two possibilities.

44
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,817
Of the three constraints offered,

45
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:31,537
the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube.

46
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:36,352
That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300.

47
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:41,303
So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES.

48
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,474
Now, let’s look at the second question.

49
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,944
If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square,

50
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:52,263
it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729–

51
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:57,007
the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube.

52
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:00,225
But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit.

53
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:04,295
So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO.

54
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:09,075
And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list,

55
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:12,204
leaving only six numbers.

56
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:16,295
Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list.

57
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:20,091
If the chef answered YES to the number 
being less than 500,

58
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,862
we’d have four options, which is too many.

59
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:26,802
But a NO leaves us with two numbers 
greater than 500,

60
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:30,792
one of which does have 
a 1 as its second digit.

61
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,532
We don’t know which of these numbers 
the interrogator thinks is correct.

62
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,772
But that doesn’t matter–

63
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,952
remember, his conclusion 
was based on lies.

64
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:44,152
You, on the other hand, are now in a 
position to reconstruct the truth.

65
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:48,702
First, the chef said the number was 
greater than 500 but lied,

66
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,904
meaning it’s actually less than 500.

67
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:56,293
Second, the chef said it wasn’t a 
perfect square but lied again,

68
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:59,211
meaning the number is indeed a square.

69
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:03,201
And finally, he truthfully confirmed 
that it was also a cube.

70
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,851
And as we’ve already seen,

71
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:10,671
the only number under 500 that’s 
both a square and a cube is 64.

72
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:15,301
You find the secret recipe and are gone 
before anyone’s the wiser.

73
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:17,750
Corporate espionage is not an easy game—

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,750
but sometimes, that’s just 
how the sausage is made.
